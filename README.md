# Algorithms-1-COS-226
A collection of assignments from Princeton's Algorithms 1 course on Coursera.

The course is the first of two parts teaching fundamental algorithms.

- Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
- Simple data structures
- Sorting algorithms
- Priority Queues
- Symbol Tables

These concepts are explored and implemented in a series of assignments, often having visual components.
