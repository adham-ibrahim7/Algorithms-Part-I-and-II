# Algorithms - Sedgewick

A collection of assignments from Princeton's Algorithms 1 and 2 courses.

The courses discuss topics including but not limited to:

- Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
- Simple data structures
- Sorting algorithms
- Priority Queues
- Symbol Tables
- Graph Theory

These concepts are explored and implemented in a series of assignments, often having visual components.
