# Percolation
This assignment explores disjoint set union, implementing an efficient DSU class to determine the value of the *percolation threshold*.

[Assignment Spec.](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php)

The calculated value of the threshold by *PercolationStats.java* is:
```
mean                    = 0.5927902199999999
stddev                  = 0.0030841916367374453
95% confidence interval = 0.5921857184391994, 0.5933947215608004
```

using 100 grids of size 1000.
